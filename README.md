RiyalScript: A High-Performance, Finance-Oriented Programming Language
Overview
RiyalScript is a high-performance, statically-typed programming language inspired by JavaScript and C++, designed for financial applications, algorithmic trading, and data-driven business solutions. It blends the simplicity and flexibility of JavaScript with the speed and efficiency of C++, making it an ideal choice for developers building high-performance trading platforms, fintech applications, and business automation tools.

The name "RiyalScript" comes from the Saudi Riyal (SAR), symbolizing precision, stability, and financial focus.

-- JavaScript-Like Syntax, C++-Like Performance
Familiar syntax for JavaScript and C++ developers.
Strongly typed, but with type inference, similar to TypeScript and modern C++.
Uses curly braces ({}) and semicolons (;), making it easy for C++ and JS devs to pick up.
-- Finance & Business-Oriented
Built-in financial types like Currency, Decimal, and InterestRate, avoiding floating-point inaccuracies.
Optimized for real-time trading algorithms, large financial datasets, and complex business calculations.
Low-latency execution, making it ideal for high-frequency trading (HFT) and automated decision-making.
-- High-Performance & Compiled
Compiled to optimized bytecode, making it faster than interpreted languages like JavaScript or Python.
Memory-efficient with manual and automatic memory management options (inspired by C++).
Supports multi-threading and concurrency, essential for real-time financial applications.
-- Interoperability with C++ and JavaScript
Can be embedded in C++ applications for performance-critical tasks.
Can interact with JavaScript via WebAssembly (WASM), making it suitable for web-based fintech solutions.
Supports API calls to web services, databases, and cloud-based financial tools.
-- Object-Oriented & Functional Hybrid
Supports classes, inheritance, and polymorphism (like C++).
Supports arrow functions and async/await (like JavaScript).
Allows functional programming features, such as higher-order functions and immutable structures.
